\section{Extension and Applications}

The application of this method is not bound to buoyancy---it could be applied on any scenario where a rigid body moves through a field, as long as the effect caused by the field on mass points obeys the divergence theorem---that is, the field should have first-order continuous partial derivatives.

Even if it doesn't have such property, our based method could downgrade to be sampling inside the volume, and the unifying step before/after combining the contributions needs to be correspondingly using the actual volume as the denominator in the scaling factor.
