Simulating rigid-body buoyancy in real-time applications faces challenges due to the lack of efficient and general-purpose geometry interfaces. Conventional methods often have to sacrifice physical realism or rely on extensive manual configuration.
This paper proposes a Monte-Carlo-based surface sampling method for buoyancy estimation, which models buoyant forces and torques uniformly by randomly sampling the submerged surfaces of objects and integrating local fluid pressures.
The method is applicable to complex geometries and allows flexible trade-offs between physical accuracy and computational cost through adjustable sampling densities, without requiring preprocessing or manual proxy configuration.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively reproduce floating, sinking, and posture adjustment behaviors in real-time environments, while exhibiting good performance scalability, making it suitable for floating object simulations in interactive applications.
