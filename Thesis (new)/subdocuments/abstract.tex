	Simulating buoyancy in real-time applications remains a challenging task due to the lack of efficient and general-purpose geometry interfaces in common game engines.
	In this paper, we introduce a Monte-Carlo-based approach that estimates buoyancy forces by surface sampling, enabling real time performance without sacrificing physical plausibility.
	Our method computes both force and torque by aggregating weighted contributions from randomly sampled surface points, and is further enhanced with physically motivated frictional terms to stabilize simulation.
	Experiments in Unity demonstrate our approach's realism and scalability, and suggest its potential to generalize to other field-object interaction scenarios.
	This work offers a practical and adaptable solution for real time buoyancy simulation in game development and interactive media.
