This is the first time I have ever written a serious academical article.
It is guaranteed that there will be naive mistakes all over the place.
Please excuse me, thou reader.
If thou hast spotted any mistake, please feel free to contact me at \url{wangnianyi2001@outlook.com}.
My apologies in advance!

Thanks to the team of my graduation project, \emph{Nani Core} (\url{https://github.com/nani-core}).
The idea of this article rose when I was making the water system in the project.
They established the possibilty for this article to happen.
Special thanks to 陈恩晖 (Omnisch) and 张嘉玥 (Limko).
They are two really, really reliable co-workers and good friends of mine.
They have given me the greatest mental and physical support on the project, and an unforgetful memory in my graduation year.

A sample project of the simulation experiment is published at \url{https://github.com/WangNianyi2001/Water-Simulation-2024}.
