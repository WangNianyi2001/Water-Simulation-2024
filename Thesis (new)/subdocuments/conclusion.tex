\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents a Monte-Carlo method for simulating buoyancy forces acting on rigid bodies in a fluid field, achieving real-time performance without specialized hardware or invasive engine modifications.
By approximating the surface integral using random samples and preserving torque contributions, we retain crucial physical characteristics while allowing a flexible trade-off between performance and realism.
The simulation results validate both the physical accuracy and computational efficiency of our approach.

Furthermore, the method integrates seamlessly into component-based game engines and generalizes to other physics-field interactions through minimal adjustments.
Despite current simplifications in fluid pressure modeling, the framework lays a foundation for future extensions toward dynamic fluids, volume effects, and parallel optimization.
We believe this approach provides both a practical tool for developers and a promising direction for future research in real-time physical simulation.
