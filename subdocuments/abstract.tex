\begin{abstract}
	Based on the idea of Monte-Carlo, we proposed a method for simulating the physical behavior of solid bodies sumberged in fluid.
	It can recreate the buoyancy effect realistically while providing the freedom to balance between quality and performance.
	It also takes care of the resistance force as the bodies move through the fluid to prevent numeric unstability.
	With proper generalization, this method can be adapted to simulate any fields that solid bodies could move through.
