	Simulating the physical interaction between fluid and solid matter in an interactive application like video games often requires complex algorithms that could be computationally expensive.
	To do it effectively, we proposed a realtime method for calculating the buoyant behavior of solid bodies sumberged in fluid based on the Monte-Carlo method.
	Our method can recreate the buoyancy effect realistically while providing the freedom to balance between quality and performance.
	It also takes care of the resistance force as the bodies move through the fluid to prevent numeric unstability.
	With proper generalization, this method can be adapted to simulate any fields that solid bodies could move through.
