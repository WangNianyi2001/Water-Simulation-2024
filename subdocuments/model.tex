\section{A Realistic Buoyancy Model}

To come out with a better model, we will start off by studying the underlying physical mechanisms of the buoyancy force.

\subsection{Problems With Archimede's Principle}

Back to 246 BC, the ancient Greek philosopher Archimede has proposed his now-famous principle on buoyancy:
\begin{quote}
	Any object immersed in a fluid is subject to an upward buoyancy force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
\end{quote}
This princle is correct in most of the cases;
however, there are still some edge cases where it will fail.
Before showing the cases, we need to understand why the princle holds in the first place.

The net buoyancy force can be seen as the unity of all the pressuring force from surrounding water applied on the floating object.
The strength of water pressure is related to many variables, including the water's density, its velocity field, the local gravity strength, etc;
but in static water, the pressure (force per unit surface area) at the same height can be seen as the same, proportional to the depth to the water surface (\ref{static-water-pressure}).
\begin{equation}
	P=\rho gh.
	\label{static-water-pressure}
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the pressure, $\rho$ is the fluid density, $g$ is the local gravity strength, and $h$ is the depth to the water surface.
For each small area $\mathrm{d}s$ with the normal direction $\mathbf n$, the surrounding fluid would cause a pressuring force of $-\mathbf nP\mathrm{d}s$ on it.
We can integrate this around the whole surface to get the net force (\ref{net-water-pressuring-force}).
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{F}_P=\oiint_{S}-\mathbf nP\mathrm{d}s.
	\label{net-water-pressuring-force}
\end{equation}
If the object is fully sunk, we then have that the integrating surface would be the boundary of the object's volume ($S=\partial V$), which is guaranteed to be a 3D manifold.
Under this assumption, using the \emph{divergence theorem} in multi-variable integration, formula \ref{net-water-pressuring-force} can be continued (\ref{archimedes-principle-formula}).
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{F}_P=\iiint_{V}\rho\mathrm{d}v=-\rho\mathbf{g}|V|.
	\label{archimedes-principle-formula}
\end{equation}
This yields exactly the Archimede's principle.

Surprisingly, when the object is only partially sunk, this equation still holds;
just that the $V$ now means only the sunk part of the geometry.
The reason that it still holds is because after taking a cut of the geometry at the water surface, the water pressure on newly cut surface would be zero, since it is overlapping with the water surface.

Together, the two cases make up the Archimede's principle.
They are covering the most cases that most people will ever face, so the principle could be used with no problem.
However, in the figure \ref{archimedes-principle-failing-case} below, Archimede's principle fails to hold on the two orange boxes.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=1.3in]{figures/ap-blind-spot.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{When Archimede's principle fails to hold.}
	\label{archimedes-principle-failing-case}
\end{figure}

Both of the two boxes have one of their surfaces sticking to the wall, but neither of the surfaces are overlapping the water's surface.
This means that if they are really touching the water, they should receive a non-zero pressure.
If we are still following formula (\ref{archimedes-principle-formula}), which is derived upon the divergence theorem, we will be incorrectly taking the wall-surfaces' fake pressure into the sum of the net force, thus leading to a wrong result.

To deal with such case, we could explicitly calculate the original integral following formula (\ref{net-water-pressuring-force}) to get the correct result; but an immediate problem is that it would require us to actually integrate all the infinitesimals.
This is imposible for computers to achieve, so we need to transform them into finite surface fragments (i.e. the \emph{Finite Element Method}).

Thankfully, all most common 3D model formats are based on polygons, so this can be done with no difficulties.
The updated formula looks like (\ref{discretized-pressuring-force}).
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{F}_P=\sum_{\text{face}}-\mathbf{n}\rho h|\text{face}|.
	\label{discretized-pressuring-force}
\end{equation}

Although this formula can be directly calculated by a computer, it leads to two new problems:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It could be a huge performance cost to iterate through all surfaces of a mesh.
	\item After discretizing into non-infinitesimal surfaces, the simple-and-nice $\rho h$ for calculating the pressure doesn't hold anymore.
\end{enumerate}

The first problem is rather easy to see;
and the reason for the second problem is that, as though the position for an infinitesimal of the surface is clearly defined, a small surface fragment has its extend in the space.
Most commonly, a surface is not aligned directly to the Y-axis, and the different parts of it would be at different depth, resulting in experiencing different pressure (figure \ref{water-pressure-differs-on-surface}).

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/water-pressure-on-small-surface.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{The water pressure differs on a surface.}
	\label{water-pressure-differs-on-surface}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Applying the Monte-Carlo Method}

By using the \emph{Monte-Carlo method}, the above two problems could be resolved.
It is a methodology of using a set of local information on random samples to estimate the accurate value, at a cost of certain amount of noise.
In the case of buoyancy, the force only affects the float object's acceleration directly, which is the second-order derivative of its location;
as the time passes, the noises generated from the randomness could accumulate and statically cancel themselves out.
Therefore, we can use a small set of water pressuring force calculated over random points on the floating body's surface to estimate the net buoyancy force without introducing too much error.

To apply the Monte-Carlo method, there are the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Generate random sample points over the surface of the target physical body;
	\item Calculate each of their pressuring forces;
	\item Sum up the forces;
	\item Regularize the summed-up result.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Sampling Over the Surface}

As already introduced previously, most game engines have poor interfaces for querying the geometry information of models, so they cannot be relied on. Sampling in the UV space might work, but there are some problems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item
		The area that a triangular face occupies in the UV space doesn't reflect its real area in the world space (or at least in its local space).
		If we were to sample in the UV space, we would have to calculate a conversion ratio to convert the area between the two spaces, like the Jacobian determinant when changing an intergral variable.
	\item Even if we do calculate the conversion ratio, there could be some faces with an zero area in the UV space.
		If this happens, such face could never possibly be sampled and thus is missing from the buoyancy calculation, which will lead to artifactual result.
\end{itemize}

One possible workaround is to generate the samples directly on the triangular faces in the world space.
\begin{itemize}
	\item For each sampling chance, first randomly choose a triangular face to sample on.
		This is completely doable by accessing the basic model information.
	\item Then, uniformly pick a pick a random point on the chosen face.
		Given that the face is a triangle, this step is trivial.
\end{itemize}

After following these steps, there is only one problem remaining:
Every faces would share the same probability to be chosen, yet they are of different sizes.
This is not desired, as a bigger face would receive bigger pressuring force in water;
but under the same probability, they would have the same contribution to the net pressuring force.
To solve this, an approach of weighted average could be applied.
\begin{itemize}
	\item We grant each sample point a weight that equals to the area of the triangluar face it lands on, so that the samples on bigger faces would make bigger contribution of force;
	\item And after all contributions are summed up, the weight sum would be divided from the totaol contribution.
\end{itemize}

An important trait of a Monte-Carlo approach is that the balance between quality and performance can be adjusted.
The higher the sample rate, the better the resulting quality, but it might cause a burden on performance;
vice versa, one could decrease the sample rate and sacrifices the quality to get a better performance.

\subsubsection{Calculating the Force on Each Sample}

Once we have the whole surface of the body model sampled, we can calculate the local water pressure forces applied on the samples.
Similar to equation (\ref{discretized-pressuring-force}), the pressure force for a sample point would be (\ref{sample-pressure-force}).
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{f}_{\text{pressure}}(s)=
	\begin{cases}
		-\mathbf{n}\rho h \ \text{if under water}, \\
		\mathbf{0} \ \text{otherwise}.
	\end{cases}
	\label{sample-pressure-force}
\end{equation}
Here the small $\mathbf{f}$ is used to indicate that this is the force on a single face, not the net force.

The weighting coefficient for each sample would be the area of the face that it lands on (formula (\ref{sample-weight})), as discussed in the previous section.
\begin{equation}
	w(s)=|\text{face}|.
	\label{sample-weight}
\end{equation}
Lastly, to sum them all up and get the regularized result:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{F}_{\text{pressure}}=\frac
		{
			\bigoplus_{s}
			\left(
				w(s)\cdot\mathbf{f}_{\text{pressure}}(s)
				,
				\text{arm}(s)
			\right)
		}
		{\sum_{s}w(s)}.
	\label{net-pressure-force}
\end{equation}
Where the $\text{arm}(s)$ is the position displacement from the sample point to the center of the body's mass.

Notice that here to add the forces together along with their positions, the $\bigoplus$ symbol is used instead of $\sum$, which is kind of a non-standard usage.
This is because that forces applied on a physical body \emph{at specific locations} can not be simply added together.

\subsubsection{Composing the Forces Together}

To see why, one could imagine a pair of opposite forces applied on the same body, but displaced from its center of mass (figure \ref{force-pair}).

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\scalebox{0.8}{
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\filldraw[color=black, fill=lightgray, line width=1pt] (0,0) circle (2);
			\draw[-latex, line width=1pt] (2,0) -- ++(0,-2);
			\draw[-latex, line width=1pt] (-2,0) -- ++(0,+2);
		\end{tikzpicture}
	}
	\caption{An opposite pair of forces applied on a round body.}
	\label{force-pair}
\end{figure}

Under the effect of the two forces, the body would rotate in place, but not move at all.
Such pair of opposite forces will not cause any movement on a physical body, but only the rotation.
If only the forces are added together, a zero vector would be expected as the result; all information about the rotation would be lost.

In general, the net physical effect on a body can be broken down into a force and a torque.
Both of them are equivalently applied on the center of the mass, so that their exact position don't need to be explicitly taken care of.
Given a positioned force $(\mathbf{f}, \mathbf{r})$, where $\mathbf{f}$ is the force and $\mathbf{r}$ is the vector from the center of mass to the point of effect, the equivalent force-torque tuple on the center of mass can be calculated by the following formulae (\ref{positioned-force-to-force-torque-tuple}).

\begin{equation}
	(\mathbf{f},\mathbf{r})_{\text{positioned force}}
	\mapsto
	(\mathbf{f},\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{f})_{\text{force-torque tuple}}.
	\label{positioned-force-to-force-torque-tuple}
\end{equation}

And to compose two force-torque tuples, simply sum them up component-wise (\ref{composing-two-force-torque-tuples}).

\begin{equation}
	(\mathbf{f}_1,\mathbf{\tau}_1)
	\oplus
	(\mathbf{f}_2,\mathbf{\tau}_2)
	=
	(\mathbf{f}_1+\mathbf{f}_2,\mathbf{\tau}_1+\mathbf{\tau}_2).
	\label{composing-two-force-torque-tuples}
\end{equation}

By applying this into formula (\ref{net-pressure-force}), the net water pressure force could then be calculated.
